# 5.0.0
Our FINAL BETA is here!
Please report bugs- new and old in case we missed something important. We hope to have our official release in a couple weeks, we just want some time to collect new bug report and have some time to fix any that arise.

- Fixed a crash on Fabric with vending machines (temporarily disabled shops)
- Temporarily hard coded Manaphy/Phione to be 10,000 walk steps (so clients can connect to vanilla servers aka server hubs)
- Removed Paradox spawns since they're crafted in RKS Machine now

Server Owners:
We believe it is safe enough to use in production now. If you've generated a world, use our sidemod to fix old PokeLoots in the plugins-mods channel. This will convert old infinite use PokeLoots to one time per player loots. We'll add more modes soon. Not all structures are implemented yet, but most are. We recommend either starting with a smaller world, or make a resource world that you will regenerate periodically

Note: This is BETA 5.0. When we release, we're going back down to 1.0 and adjust any improperly labeled versions and/or remove old/confusing ones on our Curse/Modrinth pages.
